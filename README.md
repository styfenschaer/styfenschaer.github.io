Hi there. 

I am a Ph.D student and grateful to work at the intersection of engineering, statistics, computer science, and machine learning. 
In this blog, I will mainly share with you my enthusiasm for programming and algorithms. 
I'm particularly concerned that most of what we'll be doing will have a high carryover for your projects. 
No explanations at oversimplified examples. No tutorials of stuff that hundreds of people have already explained much better than I ever could. Unfortunately, this also means that this blog is mainly aimed at advanced programmers. 
A few items I have planned for you are:

* Extending and improving [SciPy's](https://scipy.org/) [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) libriary.
* Writing a flexible and minimal-overhead [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) library binding that can be used in [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) just-in-time compiled code.
* Making [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) aware of `scipy.fft` and `numpy.fft`.
* Learning how to write Python bindings for existing C/C++ libraries using [C extensions](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html), [Cython](https://cython.org/), and [Pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Write efficient algorithms beyond Big O, e.g. writing algorithms optimized for your hardware.
* Compete with state of the art algorithms implemented in major libraries such as [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) or [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). 
* Piquing your curiosity about [Python](https://www.python.org/) by explaining fascinating, hardly documented or undocumented features and pecularities.

Most of these codes exist already and are gathering dust on my hard drive. It's time to give something back to the open source community. 

See you in the [blog section](https://styfenschaer.github.io/)!
