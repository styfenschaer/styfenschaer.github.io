Hi there. 

I am a PhD student and am grateful to be working at the intersection of engineering, statistics, computer science, and machine learning. 
In this blog, I will mainly share with you my enthusiasm for programming and algorithms. 
I will be mindful that most of what we'll be doing has a high carryover for your projects. 
No explanations with oversimplified examples. No tutorials of stuff that hundreds of people have already explained much better than I ever could. Unfortunately, this also means that this blog is mainly aimed at advanced programmers. 
Some items on my list are:

* Extending and improving [SciPy's](https://scipy.org/) [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) library.
* Writing a flexible and minimal-overhead [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) library binding that can be used in [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) just-in-time compiled code.
* Making [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) aware of `scipy.fft` and `numpy.fft`.
* Learning how to write Python bindings for existing C/C++ libraries using [C extensions](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html), [Cython](https://cython.org/), and [Pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Writing efficient algorithms beyond Big O, e.g. writing algorithms optimized for your hardware.
* Competing against the state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in major libraries such as [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) or [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). 
* Piquing your curiosity about [Python](https://www.python.org/) by explaining fascinating, hardly documented or undocumented features and peculiarities.

Most of these codes exist already and are collecting dust on my hard drive. Now I want to share them with the open source community. 

See you in the [blog section](https://styfenschaer.github.io/)!
